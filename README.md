A summer project I was working on before starting my CS studies. To learn more about Java.

KEYS - Player 1:
<br>Up: W
<br>Down: S
<br>Left: A
<br>Right: D
<br>Item 1: Q
<br>Item 2: E

KEYS - Player 2:
<br>Up: NUMPAD_8
<br>Down: NUMPAD_5
<br>Left: NUMPAD_4
<br>Right: NUMPAD_6
<br>Item 1: NUMPAD_7
<br>Item 2: NUMPAD_9

CHEATS:
<br>Z - show map
<br>X - add more movement speed and dig speed to players
<br>MOUSE BUTTONS - Explosion on cursor tile

Press the item number (1 or 2) when standing on the doorway to change your selected item.

Version notes:
<br>Made the game more fast paced.
<br>Added check for game end (death). Currently it finishes the animation if one is going on... like setting up the bomb.
<br>Gamemap is now scalable. However, if played with less than 40 width, player 2 info is not visible.
