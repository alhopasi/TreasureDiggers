A summer project I was working on before starting my CS studies. To learn more about Java.
Still unfinished as my studies began I had no more time to work on it.

Press the item number (1 or 2) when standing on the doorway to change your selected item.

There is no check for game ending, but you win if the other player loses all health.
Also, the current map is too big for the "slow" pace of the game.
There are several ways to improve the gameplay and the code, but I quit working on this.
